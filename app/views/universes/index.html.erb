<h2>Known universes</h2>
<p>My goal is to have as many "strange," "non-english," or at least "non-common" words as possible from each
	universe. I have about 200 from Dune, which makes for a good number of words to build paragraphs.
</p>
<p>Ideally, people will be able to build placeholder text from a single universe as well as jumbles of random text 
	from all of them. That'll take 100-200 words each (easy with a glossary, not so without one).
</p>
<p> If you'd like to 
	help, <a href="http://mettadore.com"> contact me</a> or just send a list of words for a given universe using the 
	<%= link_to "Wordlist instructions", home_url("wordlist") %>.
