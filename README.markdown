# Kwisatz Haderach

The placeholder text that can be in all places simultaneously.

Basically, it's a stupid waste of time. You see, I'm really bored with [Lorem Ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)
and wanted to come up with a placeholder text generator that was more fun. So I came up with this one.

The idea is that whenever I (or you, or anyone) read cool words in Science Fiction and Fantasy books, I can add them
to Kwisatz Haderach and then use the public API to generate randomized text that has a bit of a coolness factor.

The implementation will always be at the [Kwisatz Haderach homepage](http://kwisatz.hadera.ch)

This is just the boring code for a ridiculously simple, yet horribly time-wasting, Rails app.
